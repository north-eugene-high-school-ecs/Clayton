<h1>This is my game</h1>
<p>When I saw Mx.Wilsons game I decided that I wanted to do something easy since I had an example of what to do already. I designed it the way I did cause all of the stuff just popped in my head. If I had more time I probably would have done something more interesting.</p>
<h1>Instructions and Rules</h1>
<p>To start the game you press the green flag wherever it is on the screen. To move you can use the Left, Right, Up, and Down arrow keys. The goal in the game is to get 60 or more points to win. To get points you need to touch the baseball or orange ball and stay on it as long as you can and not get hit with the lava ball. Rule #1 Dont touch the balls while they are in their corners</p>
